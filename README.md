Caffeine, C Application Framework
===

Caffeine is a C language based framework which uses C99, POSIX
and SUSv3 standards, and system specific system calls -- Linux
and FreeBSD for now -- to support the development of daemons and
services. The idea is to have predefined algorithms to help you
in some tasks for building your own daemons, command line
applications and complex tasks such as integrating plugin
interfaces to your applications. The concrete goal of this project
is to implement most common algorithms to develop service oriented
applications.
