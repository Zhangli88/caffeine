STEPS FOR BUILDING CAFFEINE
===========================

Build Tools:
- CMake
- PCRE

CMake is a Makefile generator tool writen in C++. To build
Caffeine manually you must run:

$ cmake .
$ make

In the bin directory resides a script called cmk.sh, it's
script that helps in the compilation of caffeine, setting
verbose output and debug binaries generation, written to
help in debugging tasks.

To build Caffeine with cmk.sh you must run:

$ cmk.sh -mcb

To clean the proyect output, usually to get a patch:

$ cmk.sh -mc

To import the proyect into kdevelop:

$ cmk.sh -kcb

To clean the project output made by kdevelop:

$ cmk.sh -kc
