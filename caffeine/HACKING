Caffeine Hacking Guide
======================


1. Before you start
-------------------

You must read the STYLE guide.


2. What can I do?
-----------------

* Write unitary tests for every algorithm in Caffeine. If you don't
have enough time, you can submit the test and we will debug the
tests for you.

* Contribute with modules. Write a module to extend caffeine, something
  that can be usefull.

* Wait for the caffeine design specs.


3. Centralized Development
--------------------------

* Contributions are received through the development mailing list.
* Module contributions retain the original copyleft notice (copyright
  under LGPL), if you write a module, you own the copyleft notice.
* Patch and patchset contributions that affects up to 50.000001% of a
  module, means the inclusion of the proper copyleft notice in the
  module file.
* Patch and patchset contributions that affects less to 49.00001% of a
  module, means the inclusion of the author name in the AUTHORS file.


4. Avoid Compile Warnings
-------------------------

Caffeine is build under strict compilation flags. Common flags to build
caffeine are:

-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -pedantic -std=c99

This means that the code must be 100% C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1990) compilant.
Every compile warning related to this standard, must be removed. To build
Caffeine under debugging configuration, see the BUILDING text file.
