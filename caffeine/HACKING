Caffeine Hacking Guide
======================


1. Before you start
-------------------

You must read the STYLE guide.


3. Centralized Development
--------------------------

* Contributions are received through the development mailing list.
* Module contributions retain the original copyleft notice (copyright
  under LGPL).
* Patch and patchset contributions that affects up to 50.000001% of a
  module, means the inclusion of the proper copyleft notice in the
  module file.
* Patch and patchset contributions that affects less to 49.00001% of a
  module, means the inclusion of the author name in the AUTHORS file.


2. What can I do?
-----------------

* Write unitary tests for every algorithm in Caffeine. If you don't
have enough time, you can submit the test and we will debug the
tests for you.

* Contribute with modules. Write a module to extend caffeine, something
  that can be usefull.

* Wait for the caffeine design specs. We will need a lot of programmers
  or coder to implement the complete specifcation.
